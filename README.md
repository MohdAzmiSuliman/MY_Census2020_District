# MY_Census2020_District

Malaysia Census 2020 by Distrist (Administrative District)

# Disclaimer

This is personal project, data was taken from Malaysia Census 2020 Reports, available in DOSM's eStatistik page.

# Why?

DOSM publish (?store) data for Census 2020 by district, which can be accessed at https://github.com/dosm-malaysia/data-open/tree/main/datasets/census. However, the number is not tally, most likely due to rounding when summing up. Thus, I want to get from source (i.e. eStatistik).
